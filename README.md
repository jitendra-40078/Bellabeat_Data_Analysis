## Summary
In this case study I am going to analyze data from FitBit users, which is a personal health tracker. The objective is to gain insights from FitBit's secondary data, to drive business decisions for another health tracker company called BellaBeat. This data analysis can help guide BellaBeat`s marketing strategies, particularly for two of their products Leaf (tracker bracelet) and Time (wellness watch). Their main feature is tracking and measuring user wellness activities by connecting to the BellaBeat app. Then the app provides users with insights into their daily wellness, using attributes such as sleep, weight, calories burnt, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. I am going to analyze Fitbit data to find the most important problems BellaBeat might face and come up with recommendations on what tools to implement to solve them. The datasets and some instructions were provided by Google Data Analytics, which is a course on Cursera, developed by Google. The datasets are not perfect and have some limitations. The purpose is not to pass over these limitations, and make it seem like the analysis is perfectly accurate, but rather to face the limitations and discuss some possible ways to avoid them in the future. These limitations commonly occur in many similar datasets in practice. Hence, it may be useful to discuss them thoroughly.

## ACT
##### The average user takes 7,638 steps and burns 2,304 calories per day.
##### There is a positive relationship between the total number of steps and the total number of burned calories.
##### The users seem to be consistent with their total step scores throughout the week. The most active day is Saturday, and 
   the least active is Sunday.
##### The users start their day between 6 am and 8 am. They are most active between 5 pm and 7 pm and become less active at 8 pm.
##### The highest number of burned calories occurs between 5 pm and 7 pm when the users are most active. Although the average user is very active for over 30 minutes every day, they still spend 81% of their time being sedentary.
##### There is a strong, positive relationship between the total number of minutes asleep and the total time spent in bed, with users only spending an average of 39.5 minutes of their total time in bed being awake.
##### The users have a consistent sleeping schedule, with an average sleeping time of 419.8 minutes (or 7 hours) per night - with Sunday (7.6 hours) being the day where the users seem to have slept the most.
##### Recording the lowest number of steps and the highest number of minutes asleep, Sunday is likely a rest day chosen by the users.
##### The highest heartbeat rate was found from 5 PM to 7 PM.

## Recommendations
##### **Data Engineering:** We saw that the data issues that violated its integrity resulted in lots of problems throughout this case study. I will recommend Bellabeat to build a data engineering team they will collect the proper data to build a robust recommendation system.

##### **Personalized Notifications to Promote Activity:** Crate a data analysis and Data science team to build a Deep Neural Network model to collect the data in real-time and send personalized notifications to the user about their activity.

##### **Detailed Activity Counter:** The app could also provide an elegantly design, easy-to-use interface to track their activity like calories burned, heartbeat rate, and total steps.

##### **Detailed Sleeping Log:** The average user has a consistent sleeping schedule, but those who may want to improve the quality of their sleep - or simply keep track of it - could benefit from a sleeping log. The app could offer this feature and record sleep quality, the number of times one wakes up during the night, the total amount of awake time in bed, anxiety, and/or stress levels.

##### **Detailed weight log:** Bellabeat app should use smart sensors to collect the accurate weight of users. because weight is a very important factor in health issues.

##### **Weekly and Monthly Achievement Reports:** To keep the users motivated, the Bellabeat app could provide customized weekly and monthly reports regarding the total number of steps, burned calories, sleeping habits, weight loss, and total time spent on the different activity levels. The app could send congratulatory messages to those who keep up with good habits, as well as motivational tips for improvement depending on the user's overall performance.

##### **Discounts on Other Bellabeat Wellness Products and Services:** Another way to keep customers motivated is to offer special discounts on the different Bellabeat products, as well as their premium membership. Encourage users to spend more time engaging with the app. This way, the users could become more inclined to get more active and purchase more products from the company.
